When it comes to Tactical Domain-Driven Design, there are two principal options. 
Use a complex framework or provide an implementation from scratch.

Another option is the TRINITY4J, a lightweight library for DDD applications in Java. 
It distills the best solutions for common problems when applying DDD.

TRINITY4J follows the structure of the Trinity Architecture pattern. 
Thus, it is a perfect fit for Trinity-based Java applications.
Nonetheless, you can also use it in any application that does not follow the Trinity pattern.
